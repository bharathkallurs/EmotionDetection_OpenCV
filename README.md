This a simple program written in C++ using OpenCV library to demonstrate Emotion Detection from facial expression of a person.
The program captures the image from the lip region of the person and reads the lines around. Based on the read data, it compares
with previously stored values and approximates to the emotion displayed on the person's face.
The emotions currently covered are happy, sad, neutral, ecstatic, angry.

The program is developed and tested on linux environment running ubuntu 13.04.
Pre-requisite : 
1. g++ compiler
2. OpenCV library.
3. A good editor. (I use sublime-text-2)
